Friendly note to future execs :) depending on your level of technical experience as an exec this could be a little scary but don't worry it really is quite simple to add and update basic content on the site. If you have a computer scientist or someone pretty techy see if he would be willing to take the role of webmaster. It's a really simple pure HTML site so it isn't any harder than writing in Latex or Word. If there is no one don't worry, HTML is designed to be very easy for anyone to edit. Just look at the `index.html ` file - this is where tou'll find all the website content. All HTML does is provide structure to the text. So if you want to add a new section just add an `<h2><NEW_SECTION_HEADER></h2>`  tag to the `index.html` file. or ammend teh content of a pre-existing section just edit the text suroneded by a `<p>` tag. It might be daughting but you'll get used to it quickly. Else just contact anyone from the previous exec and they might be able to help :)

This is a very simple site so there is no need to add any fancy CSS or javascript. The site is designed to be simple and easy to edit. It is also future proof as we are not dependent on any external services like google sites or Wix and free of course while still giving us more flexibility to do things our way. This is what the world wide web was designed for! Allow people to share their passions and ideas for free and independently.
