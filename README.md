## Friendly note to future execs :wave:

Depending on your level of technical experience as an exec this could be a little scary, but don't worry it really is quite simple to add and update basic content on the website.

If you have a Computer Scientist or someone tech savvy on the exec see if they would be willing to take the role of webmaster. It's a really simple pure HTML site so it really isn't any harder than writing in Latex or Word. If there is no one don't worry, HTML is designed to be easy for anyone to use.

HTML is a markup tool, it isn't really a programming language but rather a means of structuring a document. Like any document you may want to separate out content into a title and various sections and paragraphs. HTML allows you to to just that.

Look at the `index.html ` file - this is where you'll find all the website content and hence be able to edit it. As stated previously all HTML does is provide structure to the text. So, if you want to add a new section, just add a `<h2>SECTION HEADER NAME</h2>` tag to the `index.html` file, or if you'd like to amend the content of a pre-existing section, just edit the text surrounded by a `<p>` tag. It might be daunting at first but you'll get used to it quickly. 

You can always just contact someone from the previous exec and they'll be able to help ease the transition and help you get to grips with the website.

## For the tech savvy

This is a very simple site so there is no need to add any fancy CSS or JavaScript. The site is designed to be simple and easy to edit by anyone, regardless of technical ability. It is also future proof as we are not dependent on any external services like Google Sites or Wix and free of course, while still giving us more flexibility to do things our way. This is what the World Wide Web was designed for! Allowing people to share their passions and ideas for free and independently.
